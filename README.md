# Tetris Game
The game of Tetris. Made with pygame by TechwithTim

# Ideas that I want to try out on the base of this repo 
1) Make pvp mode with input from one keyboard (WASD and Arrows)
2) Make "puzzle mode" (place as many shapes as possible below the line) for pvp
3) Change fonts, colors and make grid bigger
4) Add to main menu difficulty picker, where on easy the speed of shapes is less and the probability of flat lines is bigger
5) Track the highest achieved scores
